# Software Training Repository

Welcome to the Software Training Repository for the Vortex ROV team! This repository is designed to support and streamline our training program by providing a centralized location for code management, resources, and guidelines.

## Repository Structure

- **`/S1SW`**, **`/S2SW`**, **`/S3SW`**: Each squad has a dedicated folder to upload and maintain their code throughout Phase 1 training. Please ensure your code is well-organized and documented within your squadâ€™s folder.

## Squads:

- **`S1SW:`**
  - Mohamed Hesham
  - Mohamed Adel
  - Youssef Elgazzar
  - Ahmed Mahmoud
  
- **`S2SW:`**
  - Mohamed Elsayed
  - Andrew Ramez
  - Youssef Taha
  - Ahmed Emad

- **`S3SW:`**
  - Mazen Eldeep
  - Asmaa Aboshady
  - Youssef Mahmoud
  - Perihane Hossam
  - Kenzy Mohamed

## General Rules

1. **Code Submission:** Each squad is responsible for uploading their code to their designated folder. Code submission is done by making a branch from the main branch, adding your code and making the necessary modifications then submitting a pull request. You can continue to use the same branch throughout phase 1 training.
2. **Folder Organization:** Maintain a clean and organized folder structure. Use clear filenames and directories to make navigation easy.
3. **Documentation:** Provide thorough documentation for all code and projects.
5. **Support:** For questions or issues, contact @Mazen-Sakr for assistance.

## Training Outline

- **Topic 0:** Git and GitHub
- **Topic 1:** Python fundamentals
- **Topic 2:** Object-oriented programming (OOP), threading, and multiprocessing
- **Topic 3:** Control Basics: Arduino, Python Socket, and pyserial
- **Topic 4:** Machine learning, neural networks, and computer vision
- **Topic 5:** GUI Fundamentals: Creating GUIs using PyQt5 and Pygame

We look forward to a productive training period and encourage you to participate as much as possible as that will be the main factor in improving your skills and allowing you to continue to phase 2. Happy coding!
