# Software Training Repository

Welcome to the Software Training Repository for the Vortex ROV team! This repository is designed to support and streamline our training program by providing a centralized location for code management, resources, and guidelines.

## Repository Structure

- **`/Squad1`**, **`/Squad2`**, etc.: Each squad has a dedicated folder to upload and maintain their code throughout Phase 1 training. Please ensure your code is well-organized and documented within your squadâ€™s folder.
- **`/TrainingMaterials`**: Includes comprehensive guides and tutorials on Python programming, threading, multiprocessing, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more.
- **`/CodeExamples`**: Sample code snippets and projects illustrating key concepts and techniques.
- **`/Assignments`**: Skill mastery challenges and assessments to help trainees apply their knowledge.
- **`/Documentation`**: Detailed documentation for all projects and code examples, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## General Rules

1. **Code Submission:** Each squad is responsible for uploading their code to their designated folder. Ensure all code is properly commented and follows the coding standards provided in the training materials.
2. **Folder Organization:** Maintain a clean and organized folder structure. Use clear filenames and directories to make navigation easy.
3. **Documentation:** Provide thorough documentation for all code and projects, including setup instructions, usage, and any dependencies.
4. **Code Quality:** Follow best practices for coding, including writing clean, maintainable code and adhering to project guidelines.
5. **Support:** For questions or issues, contact the training coordinator for assistance.

## Training Goals

- Develop foundational skills in Python and related technologies.
- Enhance practical knowledge through hands-on assignments and projects.
- Prepare trainees for real-world software development tasks in the ROV projects.

We look forward to a productive training period and encourage you to make the most of the resources available in this repository. Happy coding!
